*markdown* is plain text that is *marked* with a set of very simple tags to produce formatted text.

The basic idea is simple, as indicated below. More information about *markdown* can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# This is a first level heading

## This is a second level heading

This is normal text.

*This text is in italics*.

**This text is bold.**

`This text is in monospaced font, often used to represent code.`

This is an equation: $y = mx + b$
  
```

This text renders as follows:

# This is a first level heading

## This is a second level heading

This is normal text.

*This text is in italics*.

**This text is bold.**

`This text is in monospaced font, often used to represent code.`

This is an equation: $y = mx + b$
