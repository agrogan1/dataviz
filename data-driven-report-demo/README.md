# Data Driven Report Demo

## RMarkdown

RMarkdown is an almost *magical* system that allows you to create documents in multiple formats. These documents may be driven by data, or contain no data whatsoever. With the click of a button, the same content can be written out to multiple formats: HTML web pages; Gitbook web books; PDF documents; ebub ebooks.

The RMarkdown system allows rapid updating of timely content into multiple output formats.

An example data driven document can be found here.

## Output Examples

### Major Formats

* [HTML file](data-driven-report-demo.html)
* [PDF](data-driven-report-demo.pdf)
* [Word](data-driven-report-demo.docx)
* [epub](data-driven-report-demo.epub)

### Slide Show Formats

> Slide show formats can be beautiful and effective for presentations. However, slide show formats may not work equally well with all screen resolutions and sizes. Slide shows may have varying performance on mobile devices.
