# Data Driven Report Demo

## RMarkdown

RMarkdown is an almost *magical* system that allows you to create documents in multiple formats. These documents may be driven by data, or contain no data whatsoever. With the click of a button, the same content can be written out (*knit*) to multiple formats: HTML web pages; Gitbook web books; PDF documents; epub ebooks.  

These different document formats will be *knit* using the most up to date data from the data source, meaning that documents can in some sense be *self-updating*.

The RMarkdown system allows rapid updating of timely content into multiple output formats. 

An example data driven document can be found here.

## Output Examples

### Major Formats

* [HTML file](data-driven-report-demo.html)
* [PDF](data-driven-report-demo.pdf)
* [Word](data-driven-report-demo.docx)
* [epub](data-driven-report-demo.epub)

### Alternative PDF formats

* [Distill](data-driven-report-demo-distill.html) (The Distill format for scientific publishing)

### Slide Show Formats

> Slide show formats can be beautiful and effective for presentations. However, slide show formats may not work equally well with all screen resolutions and sizes. Slide shows may have varying performance on mobile devices.

* [Slidy HTML Slide Show](data-driven-report-demo-slidy.html)

### Alternative PDF formats

* [Tufte](data-driven-report-demo-tufte.pdf) (Inspired by the work of Edward Tufte)

### GitBook Format

The [GitBook format](./book/background.html) is designed as an online HTML book format and may be most suitable for longer more complicated documents. Note the links to various social media in the navigation bar.
