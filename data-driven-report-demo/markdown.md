# markdown

*markdown* is plain text that is *marked* with a set of very simple tags to produce formatted text.

The basic idea is simple, as indicated below. More information about *markdown* can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

```
# This is a first level heading
## This is a second level heading

This is normal text.

*This text is in italics*.

**This text is bold.**

`This text is in monospaced font, often used to represent code.`

This is some math: $y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + u_{0j} + e_{ij}$
```

This text renders as follows:

# This is a first level heading
## This is a second level heading

This is normal text.

*This text is in italics*.

**This text is bold.**

`This text is in monospaced font, often used to represent code.`

This is some math: $y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + u_{0j} + e_{ij}$
