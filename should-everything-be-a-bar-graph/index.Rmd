# Introduction

There are many different kinds of data visualization. In the language of the `ggplot` package for R, there are many different kinds of `geom`etries that we can apply to data.

```{r, fig.cap="Multiple Geometries for Data Visualization", echo=FALSE, fig.height=1}

knitr::include_graphics("banner.png")

```

However, after a number of years of working on data visualization, I have started to think about the advantages of bar graphs. While *not every visualization needs to be a bar graph*, it sometimes seems as though many data visualizations *would work well as a bar graph*.

# These Slides

In this slide deck, I use the `ggplot` package to develop bar graphs with `geom_bar`, one of the bar graph `geom`etries. After building a basic bar graph, I apply many formatting ideas, most of which I have learned from the blog of Cedric Scherer ([https://www.cedricscherer.com/](https://www.cedricscherer.com/)).

# Simulate Some Data

N = 30

group <- c(rep("A", N), 
           rep("B", N), 
           rep("C", N)) # group variable

# mycount <- c(10, 20, 50) # count in each group

outcome <- c(rep(rnorm(N, 10, 1)),
            rep(rnorm(N, 20, 1)),
            rep(rnorm(N, 15, 1)))

mydata <- data.frame(group, outcome) # make a data frame
