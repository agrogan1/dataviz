```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# this is the setup chunk that RStudio includes automatically

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

## Social Service Agency

This is an example report using the *simulated* social service agency data.

```{r getdata}

library(readxl)

social_service_agency <- read_excel("social-service-agency.xlsx")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(social_service_agency,
       aes(x = program,
           y = mental_health_T2,
           color = program)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(title = "Mental Health by Program") +
  scale_color_viridis_d() + # Viridis "perceptually uniform" colors
  theme_minimal() # minimal theme

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
